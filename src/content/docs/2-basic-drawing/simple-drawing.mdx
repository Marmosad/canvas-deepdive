As I said before, Canvas is a simple 2D API. If you've done any coding work with Flash or Java 2D it should seem pretty familar. You get a reference to a graphics context, set some properties like the current fill or stroke color, then draw some shapes. Here are a few of examples.

In this example we set the current color to red and draw a rectangle. **Drag the numbers in the code to change the values and see how it affects the rectangle.**
