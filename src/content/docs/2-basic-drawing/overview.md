Canvas is a 2D drawing API recently added to HTML and supported by most browsers (even Internet Explorer 9 beta). Canvas allows you to draw anything you want directly in the web browser without the use of plugins like Flash or Java. With its deceptively simple API, Canvas can revolutionize how we build web applications for all devices, not just desktops.
